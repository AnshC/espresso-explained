                Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage with bold flavor, velvety crema, and a rich aroma, brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans under high pressure. It is the foundation of many popular drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos, offering a versatile and satisfying coffee experience. Known for its intense taste and quick preparation, espresso is often served in small, strong shots, ideal for savoring pure coffee flavors or adding depth to other recipes.

                Originating in Italy during the early 20th century, espresso was invented to create a faster brewing method than traditional techniques. Luigi Bezzera is credited with designing the first espresso machine in 1901, revolutionizing coffee culture by combining efficiency with a new, robust flavor profile. Over time, espresso has become a global phenomenon, representing both Italian tradition and modern coffee craftsmanship. Today, it remains a symbol of quality and artistry in the world of coffee.
