                Macchiato, meaning "stained" or "marked" in Italian, is a coffee drink where a shot of espresso is "marked" with a small dollop of milk foam. This drink highlights the bold flavor of espresso while softening its edge with just a touch of foam, making it ideal for those who enjoy a more concentrated coffee experience.

                <br />
                Originating in Italy, the macchiato was created as a way to distinguish plain espresso from espresso with milk. Its minimalist nature has made it a favorite for purists and those seeking a quick, flavorful coffee. Today, the macchiato remains a symbol of classic Italian coffee culture and craftsmanship.
