                Cappuccino is a classic coffee drink crafted with equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and a thick foam layer. Known for its creamy texture and rich taste, cappuccino offers a harmonious balance between the boldness of espresso and the smoothness of milk. It is typically served in small cups, making it a favorite for savoring a luxurious coffee experience.

                Originating in Italy, the cappuccino evolved from traditional coffee recipes and was popularized in cafes worldwide in the mid-20th century. Its name is inspired by the brown robes of the Capuchin friars, a nod to the drink's rich color and frothy top. Today, cappuccino is a symbol of Italian coffee culture and a staple on menus across the globe.
